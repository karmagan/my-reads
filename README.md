# MyReads Project

This app helps you keep track of books that you are currently reading, want to read or read already. The books are categorized into three shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". The app has two pages: one shows the books that you have put in shelves and the other page where you can search for and add more books to your shelves.
To add more book just click the add button at the lower right corner of the page.

## TL;DR

To use the app:

* install with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## Important (from Udacity)
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
